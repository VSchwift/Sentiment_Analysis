# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of a given text. It involves the classification of text as positive, negative, or neutral based on its underlying sentiment.

## Overview
Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting textual data, enabling automated systems to analyze and categorize large volumes of text. By leveraging machine learning and language processing algorithms, sentiment analysis models can provide valuable insights into customer feedback, social media sentiment, product reviews, and more.

If you would like to use the program on your machine, follow these steps:
- Run notebook.ipynb to generate the model. You can use all the data if you like but I only used a subset of data because the actual data was huge. [Link to data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- Open terminal and type <code>streamlit run app.py</code>

## Result
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.74. It is worth mentioning that the models could achieve even better performance with a larger dataset. The reported accuracy is based on a subset of the available data due to computational limitations.
